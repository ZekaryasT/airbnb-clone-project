### 2. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs, implements, and manages the relational database using MySQL. Ensures data integrity, optimal performance, backup strategies, and handles complex SQL queries and database migrations.

### 3. DevOps Engineer
Handles the automation of deployment processes using Docker and GitHub Actions. Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages server environments, and ensures smooth updates without downtime.

### 4. Security Engineer
Implements API security measures, handles authentication/authorization, and ensures secure data flow. Protects the system from vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and more.

### 5. Project Manager
Oversees the planning, coordination, and execution of the project. Manages timelines, team communication, and ensures tasks are aligned with project goals.

### 6. Technical Writer
Responsible for creating and maintaining technical documentation including README files, setup guides, and API documentation. Ensures information is clearly communicated to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building scalable, secure, and maintainable web applications. In this project, it helps build the backend logic and RESTful APIs.
  
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system that stores and manages application data like user profiles, bookings, and listings.
  
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It enhances performance and flexibility compared to traditional REST APIs.
  
- **Docker**: A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.
  
- **GitHub Actions**: A continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tool that automates testing, building, and deployment processes.
  
- **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language used for creating formatted documentation, such as this `README.md` file.

## Database Design

### 1. Users
- **id**: Unique identifier for each user
- **name**: Full name of the user
- **email**: User's email address
- **password**: Encrypted password
- **role**: Can be guest or host

A user can create multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

---

### 2. Properties
- **id**: Unique identifier for each property
- **title**: Name or short description of the property
- **description**: Detailed description of the property
- **location**: Address or geographical location
- **owner_id**: References the user who owns the property

Each property belongs to one user (host) but can have many bookings and reviews.

---

### 3. Bookings
- **id**: Unique identifier for each booking
- **user_id**: References the user who made the booking
- **property_id**: References the booked property
- **check_in_date**: Start date of the booking
- **check_out_date**: End date of the booking

A booking is made by one user for one property.

---

### 4. Reviews
- **id**: Unique identifier for each review
- **user_id**: References the user who wrote the review
- **property_id**: References the reviewed property
- **rating**: Numerical score
- **comment**: Optional text feedback

A property can have many reviews, and each review is linked to one user and one property.

---

### 5. Payments
- **id**: Unique identifier for each payment
- **booking_id**: References the related booking
- **amount**: Total payment amount
- **payment_date**: Date when payment was made
- **status**: Indicates if the payment was successful, pending, or failed

Each payment is tied to a booking.

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
User management allows users to register, log in, and update their profiles with secure authentication. This ensures that both hosts and guests can access and manage their accounts while maintaining privacy and security. It also allows users to have different roles, such as host or guest, to enable personalized functionality.

---

### 2. Property Management
The property management feature enables hosts to add and manage their property listings on the platform. Hosts can upload property details like descriptions, prices, availability, and photos. This helps create a comprehensive catalog of properties for guests to browse and book.

---

### 3. Booking System
The booking system enables guests to search and book properties based on specific criteria like location, price, and availability. This feature ensures the platform can efficiently handle multiple users and reservations, preventing double bookings, and helping guests book properties easily. It is essential for enabling transactions and interactions between users.

---

### 4. Reviews and Ratings
This feature allows guests to leave reviews and rate the properties they stay at, contributing to a system of trust and transparency. Positive reviews help boost a property’s reputation, while feedback can guide property owners in improving their listings. It also helps future guests make informed decisions when booking.

---

### 5. Payment Integration
Payment integration enables secure transactions for bookings through supported payment systems. This feature ensures that guests can pay for their bookings, and hosts can receive payments seamlessly. It is vital for securing financial data and processing payment statuses like successful or failed payments.

---

### 6. API Security
API security ensures that all data transactions between the front-end and back-end are secure, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. It implements authentication and authorization mechanisms like token-based authentication to protect user data, transactions, and other sensitive features. This is essential to protect both the platform and its users from potential threats.

---

### 7. CI/CD Integration
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) streamline the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. It automates the deployment pipeline, ensuring that the platform’s code is consistently updated with minimal human error. This reduces downtime and ensures faster delivery of new features or bug fixes.

---

### 8. Scalable Architecture
Scalable architecture ensures that the platform can handle increasing traffic and data loads as the user base grows. By using containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), the application can scale dynamically without compromising performance. This enables the system to maintain reliability and performance during periods of high demand.


## API Security

### 1. Authentication
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user before granting them access to the platform. In the case of the Airbnb Clone, we will implement **token-based authentication** using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure that only authenticated users can access restricted API endpoints. This ensures that users' data remains secure and prevents unauthorized access to their accounts or sensitive information.

**Why it's crucial:** Protecting user data is a top priority, and authentication ensures that only verified users can perform sensitive actions, such as booking properties or editing personal profiles.

---

### 2. Authorization
Authorization determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do on the platform. In this project, we will set role-based access control (RBAC) to define different user roles (e.g., guest, host, admin) and their permissions (e.g., hosts can manage properties, while guests can only book them). This ensures that users only have access to actions that match their roles.

**Why it's crucial:** Authorization ensures that each user has the appropriate permissions for their role, preventing unauthorized actions, such as a guest trying to manage a property they don't own.

---

### 3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is a technique used to limit the number of requests a user can make to the API within a given time frame (e.g., 100 requests per minute). This will be implemente
