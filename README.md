# airbnb-clone-pr# Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application designed to simulate the backend and database systems of a booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on real-world development practices, scalable architecture, and collaboration workflows.

## Project Goals
- Understand and implement backend architecture using Django.
- Design and build relational databases with MySQL.
- Develop secure, RESTful APIs.
- Implement DevOps practices using Docker and GitHub Actions.
- Collaborate efficiently in teams using Git and GitHub.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend Framework:** Django
- **Database:** MySQL
- **API:** REST & GraphQL
- **DevOps Tools:** Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
- **Documentation:** Markdown, GitHub Wiki

## Team Roles

### 1. Backend Developer
Responsible for building and maintaining the server-side logic of the application. This includes creating APIs, handling authentication, and ensuring performance, scalability, and security of the backend systems. In this project, they will work with Django and REST/GraphQL APIs.

### 2. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs, implements, and manages the relational database using MySQL. Ensures data integrity, optimal performance, backup strategies, and handles complex SQL queries and database migrations.

### 3. DevOps Engineer
Handles the automation of deployment processes using Docker and GitHub Actions. Sets up CI/CD pipelines, manages server environments, and ensures smooth updates without downtime.

### 4. Security Engineer
Implements API security measures, handles authentication/authorization, and ensures secure data flow. Protects the system from vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and more.

### 5. Project Manager
Oversees the planning, coordination, and execution of the project. Manages timelines, team communication, and ensures tasks are aligned with project goals.

### 6. Technical Writer
Responsible for creating and maintaining technical documentation including README files, setup guides, and API documentation. Ensures information is clearly communicated to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building scalable, secure, and maintainable web applications. In this project, it helps build the backend logic and RESTful APIs.
  
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system that stores and manages application data like user profiles, bookings, and listings.
  
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It enhances performance and flexibility compared to traditional REST APIs.
  
- **Docker**: A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.
  
- **GitHub Actions**: A continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) tool that automates testing, building, and deployment processes.
  
- **Markdown**: A lightweight markup language used for creating formatted documentation, such as this `README.md` file.
